// Place here the command which starts vote for the next map if necessary
// here is the example of a plugin which starts voting and finish in 25 seconds. So I set 
// EndGameDelay: 35
// EndGameSilent: false
// so I have voting during 25 sec from the win and map changed in next 10 seconds.
// ggmc_mapvote_start 25

// I have EndGameDelay set to 30 so we will make RTV last for 20 seconds
rtv 20
