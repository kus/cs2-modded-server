// Note that this file is executed every time the freeze time ends and is therefore
// significantly more heavy to use than the other confiuration files.
// 
// Because of this, do only create forced mapconfigs and add content that has to
// be set on a per round basis, if it is absolutely needed.
// E.g. if the map changes the player's gravity at the beginning of the round,
// or something of a similar sort.
